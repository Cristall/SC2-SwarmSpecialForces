# SwarmSpecialForces
 
SwarmSpecialForcesAssets.Sc2Mod contains all nessecary outsourced custom assets because assets dont need to be reuploaded each patch (reduced file size for upload from ~40 to 4 mb resulting in 10x faster upload time).
To test the map you need to change the SwarmSpecialForcesAssets dependency to your local copy of it, which should be located inside the Mods folder within your Starcraft 2 install directionary. If you do not change the dependency the game will not load the game/crash upon start.
