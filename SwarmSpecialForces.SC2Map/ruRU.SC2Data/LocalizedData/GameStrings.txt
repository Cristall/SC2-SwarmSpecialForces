Button/Tooltip/KingMoopy=The hidden mastermind who manipulates from the shadows. First he let Stetmann send out a distress call to get the the terran mercenaries and special forces to deploy a rescue team. At the same time he abducted protoss engineers from the facility which resulted in the their search squad to fight against the swarm. Then he forced Stetmann do engineer mechanical zergs as it seemed those are the strongest but even those could not stop the swarm. Might be related to the creep clogging all the mechanical parts.
Button/Tooltip/Lightning=His coolness is awefully stunning and has stopped many foes.
Button/Tooltip/Madness=It was once called Probius, the heroic probe, but people did not realize its full potential and so, after mining these terrazine crystals, it tapped into madness.
Button/Tooltip/MechaArtanis=A mechanical replication of Artanis. How does Stetmann even know how Artanis looks?
Button/Tooltip/MechaKerrigan=A mechanical replication of Kerrigan. Stetmann hopes that her image would scare the swarm from attacking further.
Button/Tooltip/MechaOvermind=A really huge CPU with unnecessary long tentacles that have no function whatsoever. It was designed to calculate the question to the answer 42. With great disappointment to Stetmann it was better at destroying things so it was refurbished and put into the pit to prevent it from smashing Stetmann.
Button/Tooltip/MechaRaynor=A mechanical replication of Raynor. Stetmann still holds a grudge against Raynor for forgetting him in the lava filled tunnels on Char. Now Stetmann lives in tunnels without lava and is very happy about it.

Button/Tooltip/RespawnEgg=Create an egg which allows one player to be saved from death. The saved player will respawn inside the egg after some time with half life. The egg must be placed on creep.<n/>The time to revive depends on the maximum life of the hero that is being revived and your spellpower.<n/>After an egg has been used to revive a player you need to successfully clear a boss fight to spawn another egg.<n/><n/>The egg grows and after <d ref="Behavior,RespawnEgg@HiveAuraDelay,Duration"/> seconds it is fully mature. If the hive is alive then the mature egg will provide a slightly weaker version of the hive aura.
Button/Tooltip/RespawnEgg@CarryEgg=Pick up your egg and carry it to another location. While the egg is carried, it will not provide the aura, but reviving will still work which will make the egg drop on location.
Button/Tooltip/RespawnEgg@DropEgg=Drop the egg at target location.

Button/Tooltip/RoachWarren2=<c val="ffff8a">Enables:</c><n/>- Roaches from Larvae

Button/Tooltip/SplashRangeUpgrade=Increases the splash range of your units.

Button/Tooltip/TheySeeMeRolling=Throw a big baneling and let it roll over all your enemies. It pushes small enemies out of the way and deals <d ref="$AccumulatedValue:Effect,TheySeeMeRolling@Dmg,Amount$"/> damage at the same time.<n/><n/>Bosses and structures make the baneling explode which deals <d ref="$AccumulatedValue:Effect,TheySeeMeRolling@FinalExplosionDmg,Amount$"/> damage.<n/><n/>They see me rollin'<n/>They hatin'.
Button/Tooltip/Thor=Hammer's pilot, Thor, sometimes claims to be a god, but trust me, he just delusional.

For <d ref="Behavior,UltimateBeing@UltimateBuff,Duration" precision="2"/> seconds you get +<d ref="Behavior,UltimateBeing@UltimateBuff,Modification.DamageDealtScaled[Ranged]" precision="2"/> damage, +<d ref="Behavior,UltimateBeing@UltimateBuff,DamageResponse.ModifyFraction-1*(-100)" precision="2"/>% damage reduction and +<d ref="Behavior,UltimateBeing@UltimateBuff,Modification.MoveSpeedMultiplier-1*100" precision="2"/>% movement speed.<n/>Your team does not get any benefit.<n/><n/>All Spitter ability cooldowns are shared.
Button/Tooltip/UpgradeCenter=This mutated overlord is nearly invincible due to its high regeneration. The only drawback from this mutation is that it cannot move while it regenerates.<n/>Another feature is its ability to continuously spread creep which does not decay.<n/>The swarm also made it possible to convert biomass from killed enemies into upgrades for the heroic zergs on the battlefield.

A full list can be found in the discord but you can always check other players achievements and look at the rewards. Generally they boost your overall power level.<n/><n/>Q: How do I find essences?<n/>A: Find cloaked larva (Normal or higher difficulty). You can spot them with a keen eye. Then bring your overlord to decloak it and kill it. Essence can be looted then.<n/><n/>Q: How do I unlock lurkers?<n/>A: Capture scientists. After collecting 10 of them you will be able to build them at your overlord.<n/><n/>Q: How do I reach part 2 (protoss)?<n/>A: After killing all terran bosses you will get a hint. After some time there will be more hints.<n/><n/>Q: How do I get psi orbs?<n/>A: Part 2 exclusive collectible. Also check if it actually shows in the objective list. If it does, search the map before killing Atlantis (last boss).<n/><n/>

Trig/Tutorial/Scientist=There is a terran scientist nearby.<n/>The scientist will be stunned once his life is low.<n/>While stunned you can use your overlord to capture him.<n/>In a classic game the scientist spawns at a randomized location.<n/>Capturing enough scientists allows you to train cybernetic enhanced zergs from your overlord.
Trig/Tutorial/ScientistCaptured=To show you what types of cybernetic units you can unlock, here are some Runlings for free.
Trig/Tutorial/ScientistObjective=Capture the scientist.
Trig/Tutorial/SurvivedWidowMines=Killing spawners will provide you with Mutations. <n/>Use Mutations to upgrade your regeneration and attack speed at your overlord.
